- 👋 Hi, My name is Gurkeerat Bains.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning all sorts of languages and even getting into more complex things such as maybe video game development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++. I have learned a bit of Java, but that is about it. I want to expand and learn phython and more about java. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I am just a beginner looking to advance in the world or computer science. 
- 📫 How to reach me, my email is bainsg21@students.ecu.edu
